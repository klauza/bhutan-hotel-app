## About
`app` :
It's a handracfted frontend application with my authorship, made with tools like React, Redux and styled-components.

`project` :
"Bhutanotel" is an abstract hotel facility located in the capitol of Bhutan - Thimphu. <br/>
The hotel offers for a newcomer a set of high standard apartments to rent; a guide to hire or car to lease.<br/>
The enterprise was founded for travellers and world-explorers to provide them a cosy, luxury and pleasant place to stay between their demanding adventures. <br/>
